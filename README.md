# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Summary
The website is a diary-tracking platform designed to provide users with a personalized space for
recording and reflecting on their daily experiences, emotions, and activities. The primary goal of
the website is to allow users to document their thoughts, track their moods, and create a digital
diary that serves as a valuable tool for self-reflection and emotional awareness.
